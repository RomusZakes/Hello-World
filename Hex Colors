We usually use decimals, or base 10 numbers, which use the symbols 0 to 9 for each digit.
Hexadecimals (or hex) are base 16 numbers.
This means it uses sixteen distinct symbols.
Like decimals, the symbols 0-9 represents values zero to nine.
Then A,B,C,D,E,F represent values ten to fifteen. Altogether, 0 to F can represent a digit in hexadecimal, giving us 16 total possible values.
In CSS, we can use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors, two each for the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components.
For example, #000000 is black and is also the lowest possible value.
