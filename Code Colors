We usually use decimals, or base 10 numbers, which use the symbols 0 to 9 for each digit.
Hexadecimals (or hex) are base 16 numbers.
This means it uses sixteen distinct symbols.
Like decimals, the symbols 0-9 represents values zero to nine.
Then A,B,C,D,E,F represent values ten to fifteen. Altogether, 0 to F can represent a digit in hexadecimal, giving us 16 total possible values.
In CSS, we can use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors, two each for the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components.
For example, #000000 is black and is also the lowest possible value.

Color	Hex Code
Dodger Blue - #2998E4
Green       - #00FF00
Orange	    - #FFA500
Red         -	#FF0000

Many people feel overwhelmed by the possibilities of more than 16 million colors.
And it's difficult to remember hex code. Fortunately, you can shorten it.
For example, red's hex code #FF0000 can be shortened to #F00.
This shortened form gives one digit for red, one digit for green, and one digit for blue.
This reduces the total number of possible colors to around 4,000.
But browsers will interpret #FF0000 and #F00 as exactly the same color.

Color	Short Hex Code

Cyan	#0FF
Green	#0F0
Red	#F00
Fuchsia	#F0F


Another way you can represent colors in CSS is by using RGB values.

The RGB value for black looks like this:

rgb(0, 0, 0)

The RGB value for white looks like this:

rgb(255, 255, 255)

Instead of using six hexadecimal digits like you do with hex code,
with RGB you specify the brightness of each color with a number between 0 and 255.
If you do the math, the two digits for one color equal 16 times 16, which gives us 256 total values.
So RGB, which starts counting from zero, has the exact same number of possible values as hex code.

Color	RGB

Blue	rgb(0, 0, 255)
Red	rgb(255, 0, 0)
Orchid	rgb(218, 112, 214)
Sienna	rgb(160, 82, 45)
